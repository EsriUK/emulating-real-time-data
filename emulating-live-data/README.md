# **Emulating live data**

## What does it do?
Have you ever wanted to demonstrate a real-time tracking concept without setting up ArcGIS Enterprise and GeoEvent Server? 

This application works on a csv of name, longitude and latitude. It uses a feature service,Â the ArcGIS API for Python & Jupyter Notebook. 



Details on how get started with this project can be found on GeoNet [here](https://community.esri.com/people/smcgeeesriuk-esridist/blog/2018/06/05/emulating-live-data).
